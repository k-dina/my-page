My Cat Truffle 🐈
This page is dedicated to my cat, Truffle. He is a 12-year-old cat who has been with me for a long time.

About Truffle
Truffle is a cat of simple tastes. His two favorite hobbies are eating and sleeping. He can often be found curled up in a sunbeam or on a soft blanket, dreaming of his next meal.

Despite his sweet-sounding name, Truffle can be a bit of a troublemaker. He has a knack for meowing loudly at 4 a.m., knocking things off tables, and generally being a nuisance. However, he always manages to get away with it thanks to his charming personality and loud purr.
